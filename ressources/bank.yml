# this files contains the saved data for the bank

# here you can override values for each material
# the DEFAULT will be used if a material is not listed

DEFAULT:
 # profit determines the value at which the bank will buy an item.
 # for example, if the value of diamond is at  500$, the bank will only pay players 450$ for it
 # but players will pay full price.
 # profit: 0.10

 # initial value
 # default value = 10
 initial_value: 10

 # last_sold ==> saves the last time the item was sold
 # last_bought ==> saves the last time the item was bought

 # current item value
 # data saved by plugin
 # if not set, will be set to initial_value
 current_value: 10

 # minimum value, value will not decrease bellow this
 # it can not be set lower than 0.0000001
 # default value = 1
 min_value: 1

 # maximum value, value will not increase higher than this
 # bellow zero means infinite maximum double value
 # default value = -1
 max_value: -1

 # current quantity in the bank
 # default value = 500
 current_quantity: 500

 # maximum quantity that the bank can hold
 # player won't be able to sell pass that
 # negative value means infinite
 # default value = 100 000
 max_quantity: 100000

 # minimum quantity the bank has to hold
 # players won't be able to buy bellow this
 # negative value means infinite
 # settings both max and min quantity to infinite just means to not take in account the bank quantity att all
 # default value = 0
 min_quantity: 0

 # limit the quantity per transaction
 # for example, setting this to 32 will limit the quantity of each transaction (buy or sell) for this item at 32
 # meaning, a player wont be able to buy or sell more then 32 of this item per transaction
 # you should consider this because the value is adjusted after a whole transaction
 # for example, if the price_drop is at 0.01, current_value at 10.0, if you buy 32 of this item, current_value will now equal 10.0 + 32 * 0.01 = 10.32
 # settings it to a value bellow zero means there is no limit.
 transaction_limit: -1

 # time_diff_drop: 1440 ==> you can override this value for any specific item
 # diff_price_drop: 0.01 ==> you can override this value for any specific item
 # price_drop: 0.01 ==> settings this parameters will override default_price_drop from config.yml
 # price_increase: 0.01 ==> settings this parameters will override default_price_increase from config.yml
